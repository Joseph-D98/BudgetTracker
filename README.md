# Budget Tracker

## Description
Budget Tracker allows users to track their budget and get an overview of spending habits. It does this by allowing users to enter transactions that will either add to or subtract from the account total. Once a transaction has been processed, the balance history graph will update to show this latest transaction. If there is no internet conection, a completed transaction will be stored and processed once an internet connection is reestablished.<br>Deployed Application: https://fathomless-castle-79106.herokuapp.com/
